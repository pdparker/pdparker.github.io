	<p>In Australia, gap-years are typical taken upon receiving a university place offer which is deferred. All major universities and colleges in Australia offer deferment options of at least one-year (<a href='http://www.uac.edu.au/documents/undergraduate/deferment-policies.pdf'>http://www.uac.edu.au/documents/undergraduate/deferment-policies.pdf</a>). There are many reasons in Australia for youth to take a gap-year. These reasons include studying for qualifications (not university), duties at home/looking after children, but are mainly simply wanting to take a break, or to work (Lumsden & Stanwick, 2012). Taking a break often includes travelling overseas, or through the country, and is often combined with working (Curtis, 2014). Youth who take a gap-year to work often also do this to take a break from studying, but also to gain more financial independence (Rothman & Edwards, 2013). A reason that is perhaps unique to the Australian context is qualifying for the Youth Allowance benefit and thus gaining financial independence (Curtis, 2014; Rothman & Edwards, 2013).  In Australia youth who earned an income sufficient to support themselves in a period of 18 months prior to university enrolment are eligible for Youth Allowance as financial support from the government. This is one of the main reasons of deferment for youth who live in non-metropolitan areas, as they are less likely to have a large 'local' university campus, and so have to move away from home in order to study (Rothman & Edwards, 2013). Other than having a geographical disadvantage, other characteristics of youth in Australia who take a gap-year include: lower than average university entrance rank (low achieving students; Curtis, 2014), an unfavourable attitude towards education (Curtis et al., 2012), an English speaking home background, and a low preference course university offer (Curtis, 2014).</p>
