	<p>The Finnish education system provides a useful context in which to assess the effects of a gap year for several reaons. Firstly, the university track in Finland is associated with a great deal of achievement pressure, high study demands, and increased challenges to academic efficacy (Parker & Salmela-Aro, 2011; Salmela-Aro, 2009). As such many young people complete high school with considerable achievement pressure and stress, which may indicate that a gap-year would be beneficial (King, 2011, 2013). Second, entry into the university system is relatively time intensive for many young people. This is because of the presence of a numerus clausus specific to each field of study in the Finnish tertiary education. This restricted entry is based on the applicants previous record of study and a highly competitive entrance exam (Eurydice, 2010). Third, the Finnish university entry system which encourages a moratorium period, has come under increasing scrutiny by Finnish policy makers and the general public (Higher Education Task Force, 2010).</p>
